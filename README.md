# GhibliCli

The Ghibli_Cli is an application that gives users a list of all Studio Ghibli films and provides detailed information about each film. Users can simply enter the number of a film from the provided film list, and will receive detailed information about that corresponding film. Users also have the option of generating a random film by entering "random". That will output a random Studio Ghibli film, along with the films detailed information. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Ghibli_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Ghibli_cli
